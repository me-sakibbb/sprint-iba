Scale the ratios:\n$P_1 : P_2 : P_3 = 81 : 90 : 72$ (Multiply R1 by 9)\n$P_2 : P_4 : P_5 = 90 : 95 : 100$ (Multiply R2 by 5)\nCombined Ratio: $P_1 : P_2 : P_3 : P_4 : P_5 = 81k : 90k : 72k : 95k : 100k$.\n2. Use the Profit Difference:\n$P_5 - P_1 = 19$ crore.\n$100k - 81k = 19 \\implies 19k = 19 \\implies k = 1$.\n3. Calculate Total Profit:\nTotal Ratio Sum $= 81 + 90 + 72 + 95 + 100 = 438$.\nTotal Profit $= 438k = 438 \\times 1 = 438$ crore.",
